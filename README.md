# Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that detects face masks in images.

## Overview

This project implements a CNN model to detect face masks in images using Python. Google Colab was utilized as the development environment.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, TensorFlow, OpenCV

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WarunaDissanayake1234/Face-Mask-Detection.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow opencv-python-headless
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload the provided notebook to Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to import dependencies, create labels, process images, split data into training and testing sets, train the CNN model, and build a predictive system for face mask detection.

## Files

- `face_mask_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for face mask detection using a Convolutional Neural Network.
- `data/`: Directory containing the face mask dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains images with and without face masks. The CNN model aims to accurately classify these images based on the presence or absence of face masks.
